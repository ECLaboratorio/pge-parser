# Parser for programme expense breakdowns (Serie Roja / Red books), i.e. pages like [1].
#
# Note: for some unknown reason, chapter 6 items are not broken down into articles. This 
#       seems to happen everywhere, not just for Social Security or for a particular programme
#       (f.ex. [2]). Bizarrely, the 'programme summaries' [3] do contain the chapter 6 breakdown,
#       but many other details are missing: compare [3] with [1]. At the moment we do not try 
#       to combine [1] and [3] to get the full picture, we learn to live with [1] instead, 
#       and thank our burocratic overlords.
#
# XXX: This parser has only been tested with the Social Security (section 60) programmes.
